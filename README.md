# Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project

This project is my debut end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution, developed for AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing consumer electronics company. The goal was to provide actionable insights across multiple business domains using Power BI and modern data practices.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware heavily relied on Excel for analysis, which created challenges in handling large datasets and limited decision-making speed. This became critical during a major financial setback in Latin America.

## Objective

To build interactive, stakeholder-focused dashboards in Power BI that address business questions from the following perspectives:

Finance

Sales

Marketing

Supply Chain

Executive View

📊 Data Overview

Source: MySQL Database (extracted using SQL queries)

Modeling: Snowflake schema

Transformations: Power Query for cleaning, merging, and calculated columns

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL – for data extraction

Power BI Desktop – for dashboard creation

Excel – for initial exploration

Power Query – for ETL & transformations

DAX Studio – for performance optimization

Power BI Service – for publishing & sharing

🔄 Approach
